  abstract: 'We conduct a numerical investigation of fiber-based entanglement distribution over distances of up to 1600km using a chain of processing-node quantum repeaters. 
  We determine minimal hardware requirements while simultaneously optimizing over protocols for entanglement generation and entanglement purification, as well as over strategies for entanglement swapping. 
  Notably, we discover that through an adequate choice of protocols the hardware improvement cost scales linearly with the distance covered. Our results highlight the crucial role of good protocol choices 
  in significantly reducing hardware requirements, such as employing purification to meet high-fidelity targets and adopting a SWAP-ASAP policy for faster rates. To carry out this analysis, 
  we employ an extensive simulation framework implemented with NetSquid, a discrete-event-based quantum-network simulator, and a genetic-algorithm-based optimization methodology to determine minimal hardware 
  requirements.'

  abstract: 'Quantum oscillators with nonlinear driving and dissipative terms have gained significant attention due to their ability to stabilize cat-states for universal quantum computation. 
  Recently, superconducting circuits have been employed to realize such long-lived qubits stored in coherent states. We present a generalization of these oscillators, which are not limited to coherent states,
  in the presence of different nonlinearities in driving and dissipation, exploring different degrees. Specifically, we present an extensive analysis of the asymptotic dynamical features and of the storage 
  of squeezed states. We demonstrate that coherent superpositions of squeezed states are achievable in the presence of a strong symmetry, thereby allowing for the storage of squeezed cat-states. 
  In the weak symmetry regime, accounting for linear dissipation, we investigate the potential application of these nonlinear driven-dissipative resonators for quantum computing and quantum associative memory
  and analyze the impact of squeezing on their performance.'

  abstract: 'Algorithms for associative memory typically rely on a network of many connected units. The prototypical example is the Hopfield model, whose generalizations to the quantum realm are 
  mainly based on open quantum Ising models. We propose a realization of associative memory with a single driven-dissipative quantum oscillator exploiting its infinite degrees of freedom in phase space. 
  The model can improve the storage capacity of discrete neuron-based systems in a large regime and we prove successful state discrimination between $n$ coherent states, which represent the stored patterns 
  of the system. These can be tuned continuously by modifying the driving strength, constituting a modified learning rule. We show that the associative-memory capacity is inherently related to the existence 
  of a spectral gap in the Liouvillian superoperator, which results in a large timescale separation in the dynamics corresponding to a metastable phase.'

  abstract: 'Distribution of high-quality entanglement over long distances is a key step for the development of a future quantum internet. Exponential photon loss related to distance in optical fibers 
makes it impractical to connect two nodes directly. Furthermore, the impossibility of copying general quantum states forbids using the same solutions as in classical communication. 
Quantum repeaters can be used to extend entanglement to longer distances using teleportation; nonetheless, straightforward application still leads to an exponential decrease in the link quality. 
Entanglement purification probabilistically allows us to obtain a few high-quality links from many low-quality ones. Several protocols combining quantum repeaters with purification have been proposed. 
However, the hardware quality is still lacking. Moreover, it is unclear how an improvement over a certain hardware parameter affects the final link quality or entanglement generation rate. 
Analytical expressions are hard to find and usually, assumptions are needed, limiting their applicability. In this work, a realistic repeater chain is modeled using NetSquid, 
a discrete-event-based quantum network simulator. A genetic algorithm-based optimisation methodology is then applied to determine what entanglement distribution protocol allows for minimal improvement 
over current hardware, and what these improvements must be in order to achieve a target link quality and distribution rate. In this thesis, we aim to make the path toward scalable quantum repeaters clearer, 
as well as understand how entanglement purification can enable this goal. We conclude that quantum repeaters are necessary to connect distances larger than 200km. 
We also find that entanglement purification enables achieving target metrics with lower hardware cost when the internode distance is approximately 100km, where a balance is found between a low rate for 
longer separations and too-demanding hardware for shorter ones. Finally, we analyze the growth of the hardware cost with the distance showing that, with the best choice of protocols, it scales linearly. 
We believe that these results constitute a valuable stepping stone towards a blueprint for a pan-European quantum internet.'

  abstract: 'The Copenhaguen interpretation provides a mathematical framework that has proved useful to evaluate the probabilities for future events in terms of our previous knowledge of a system. 
However, it is a source of controversy since any physical intuition we want to give  on  the  processes yields paradoxes like instantaneous collapse, spooky action at a distance... 
The goal of the relational interpretation is to solve some of them without changing the actual formalism, purely by focusing our attention on what is really the intrinsic property of Quantum Mechanics: 
discreteness.'

  abstract: 'The identification of abrupt changes in the behaviour of a system is of crucial importance in areas such as medicine, climatology, biology... Here we will discuss the problem in the quantum
world, we will consider a source generating a certain state which suffers an alteration and suddenly changes to another. The question is to find the position of the change based on measures carried
out on the states with the greatest possible probability of success. Recently, the solution to the problem was found when the two states, before and after the change, were pure. In this thesis,
we will study the case in which the states are mixed and therefore the uncertainty in the system increases. We will use both analytical and numerical techniques to find the optimal measure that
maximises the probability of correctly identifying the point of change.'
